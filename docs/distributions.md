# Distributions

Den is one engine, `@monster-orange/den`. You run it through a small repo of
your own, a **distribution**, that installs Den as a package and holds
everything that makes it yours: its name, brand, config, manifests and tests.
Den's own checkout is itself a distribution, named `den`.

## Create one

```sh
npx @monster-orange/den create acme          # writes ./acme
npx @monster-orange/den create acme ~/src/acme-dev --title "Acme Dev"
```

From a Den checkout, `./bin/den create acme ../acme` does the same.

| Option                  | Default             | What                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `<name>`                | (required)          | Product name: `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`       |
| `[dir]`                 | `./<name>`          | A new or empty directory              |
| `--title <title>`       | `<Name>` Title Case | Brand name shown to people            |
| `--cli <cli>`           | `<name>`            | The command people type               |
| `--env-prefix <PREFIX>` | `<NAME>`            | Env-var prefix (`ACME` → `ACME_HOME`) |

`create` refuses a directory that is not empty and never overwrites a file.
[`examples/distribution/`](../examples/distribution) is exactly the output of
`den create acme`; a unit test regenerates it, so the two never drift
(`npm run example:regen` after changing the scaffolder).

Then:

```sh
cd acme
npm install
./bin/acme --help
./bin/acme web          # the web UI, branded "Acme"
make help
```

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `den.yml`                 | The product profile ([below](#denyml-the-product-profile))   |

## den.yml: the product profile

Every runtime name derives from `product.name`. Set only what you want to
differ.

```yaml
product:
  name: acme
  # cli: acme
  # env_prefix: ACME
  # config: config/acme.yml
  # manifest: .acme.yml
  # state_dir: ~/.acme
  # services_dir: .acme-services
  # workspaces_dir: acme-workspaces
```

| Field            | Default              | What it names                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | `den`                | The product; `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`. Everything below derives from it  |
| `cli`            | `<name>`             | The command shown in help, hints and the web UI                   |
| `env_prefix`     | `<NAME>` (`-` → `_`) | Env vars: `<PREFIX>_ROOT`, `<PREFIX>_HOME`, `<PREFIX>_INVOKE_CWD` |
| `config`         | `config/<name>.yml`  | The org config, relative to the distribution root                 |
| `manifest`       | `.<name>.yml`        | The manifest file a repo carries; the `.json` twin is also read   |
| `state_dir`      | `~/.<name>`          | Per-user state: web server, daemons, logs, history                |
| `services_dir`   | `.<name>-services`   | Managed clones, relative to the distribution root                 |
| `workspaces_dir` | `<name>-workspaces`  | Workspace checkouts, relative to the distribution root            |

Env vars, with `ACME` as the prefix:

| Variable          | What                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ACME_ROOT`       | The distribution root, if Den cannot find it from the entry script |
| `ACME_HOME`       | Overrides `state_dir` (two instances on one machine stay apart)    |
| `DEN_ROOT`        | The same as `<PREFIX>_ROOT`; the shim sets it                      |
| `DEN_ENGINE_ROOT` | Den's package directory; `bin/den` sets it                         |
| `DEN_PROFILE`     | Read another profile file instead of `<root>/den.yml` (tests)      |

## Brand

What people see: the CLI banner and help header, web page titles and the
edge's web route. Read from `brand:` in the org config; every field is
optional.

```yaml
brand:
  name: Acme # default: the product name, first letter upper-cased
  tagline: Acme local dev and E2E harness # default: "Local dev and E2E harness"
  banner: # optional ASCII-art lines; default: the name spelled out
    - "  ┌───────────┐"
    - "  │  A C M E  │"
    - "  └───────────┘"
```

| Field     | Used for                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | Web page `<title>`s, the banner fallback, the web route on the edge (`acme`) |
| `tagline` | The line under the banner                                                    |
| `banner`  | The CLI and web server startup banner                                        |

Runtime names (env vars, files, directories) always come from `den.yml`,
never from the brand.

## The bin shim

`bin/<cli>` is three lines of sh: it names the distribution root and runs
Den from `node_modules`.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
DEN_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"
export DEN_ROOT; exec "$DEN_ROOT/node_modules/@monster-orange/den/bin/den" "$@"
```

`package.json` also lists it under `bin`, so `npm link` (or a global
install of the distribution) puts `acme` on your PATH.

Den's own `bin/den` sets `DEN_ENGINE_ROOT` to its own package directory and
sets `DEN_ROOT` only when it is unset and the engine directory holds a
`den.yml` (Den's own checkout). An installed Den ships no `den.yml`, so the
engine directory is never taken for a distribution. `DEN_USE_DIST=1` still
runs a compiled `dist/` build when one exists.

## make: den.mk

A distribution's `Makefile` includes Den's targets from the package:

```make
DEN_TARGET_PREFIX := acme
include node_modules/@monster-orange/den/make/den.mk
```

`DEN_TARGET_PREFIX` names the service and setup targets: `make acme-up`,
`acme-down`, `acme-status`, `acme-logs`, `acme-graph`, `acme-workspace`,
`acme-setup` and the rest (default `den`). `den create` sets it to the CLI
name.

`den.mk` defines:

| Variable         | What                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEN_ENGINE`     | Den's package directory (the directory above `den.mk`)                |
| `DEN_TSX`        | The tsx binary: Den's own, or the one npm hoisted into `node_modules` |
| `DEN_PLAYWRIGHT` | The playwright binary, found the same way                             |
| `DEN_BIN`        | `$(DEN_ENGINE)/bin/den`                                               |
| `DEN_ROOT`       | Exported: the directory make runs in (`$(CURDIR)`)                    |

and includes `make/test.mk`, `local_dev.mk`, `journeys.mk`, `security.mk` and
`demo.mk`: `make test`, `make web`, `make <prefix>-up`, `make test-syn-all
repo=<repo>`, `make test-smk-all repo=<repo>`, `make test-perf
module=<module>`, `make test-jrn-all`, `make test-sec-all` and the rest.
Recipes run from the distribution root (reports and staged tests land there)
and reach Den's files through `$(DEN_ENGINE)`. `make help` lists the main
targets; define your own `help` by setting `DEN_OWN_HELP := 1` before the
include. Add your own targets below it.

## Two roots

Den resolves two directories (`src/shared/paths.ts`, `src/shared/engine.ts`):

- the **engine root** (`getEngineRoot()`, `enginePath()`): Den's own files,
  `src/`, `make/`, `scripts/`; `node_modules/@monster-orange/den` in a
  distribution;
- the **distribution root** (`getDistRoot()`, `distPath()`): `den.yml`,
  config, manifests, `tests/pillars/`, reports, results, staged tests.

Den's scripts run with the engine's tsx (`tsxCommand()`), never through `npx`
or a path relative to the current directory. In Den's own checkout both roots
are the same directory.

## Running the web UI as a service (macOS)

Den ships a launchd installer that runs the web UI at login and restarts it if
it exits. From the distribution root:

```bash
DEN_ROOT="$PWD" DEN_SERVICE_LABEL=local.acme.web \
  node_modules/@monster-orange/den/service/install.sh            # install or refresh
node_modules/@monster-orange/den/service/install.sh status      # with the same env
node_modules/@monster-orange/den/service/install.sh uninstall
node_modules/@monster-orange/den/service/install.sh print       # the plist only
```

| Variable            | Default                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `DEN_ROOT`          | required in a distribution               |
| `DEN_SERVICE_LABEL` | `local.<distribution dir name>.web`      |
| `DEN_SERVICE_LOGS`  | `~/Library/Logs/<distribution dir name>` |

The service runs the engine's server with the `node` on your `PATH` at install
time, from the distribution root; re-run `install` after changing node versions
or upgrading Den. Keep the label stable: it is how launchd knows the service.

## Pinning and upgrading

`package.json` pins an exact Den version (`create` writes the version that
ran it). Den is pre-1.0: read the **Migrations** section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for every version between yours and the
target, make the config and manifest changes it lists, then:

```sh
npm install @monster-orange/den@<version> --save-exact
./bin/acme --version
```

Installing from a tarball (`npm pack` of a Den checkout, before a version is
on npm): every tarball Den hands out has its own prerelease number
(`0.1.0-dev.1`, `-dev.2`, …). npm caches a tarball by version and
integrity, so a repacked tarball with an unchanged version reinstalls the
old copy; if you ever repack one yourself without bumping, remove
`node_modules/@monster-orange/den` and its `package-lock.json` entry first.

## Developing Den against a distribution

To try a Den change in a distribution, install your checkout instead of the
published package:

```sh
cd acme
npm install ../den        # node_modules/@monster-orange/den → your checkout
./bin/acme status
```

npm links the directory, so edits to Den's `src/` take effect on the next
run (Den runs its TypeScript with tsx; there is no build step). Den's
checkout has its own `den.yml`, but the shim's `DEN_ROOT` wins, so the CLI
still runs as the distribution. Put the pinned version back with `npm
install @monster-orange/den@<version> --save-exact` before committing.

To check a change the way CI does, run `scripts/dist-smoke.sh` in Den's
checkout: it packs Den, scaffolds `acme` from the tarball, installs the
tarball into it, and checks the CLI, make targets and web server.
